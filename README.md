## Who Am I?

* üìß 104024402@student.swin.edu.au


## Purpose

* This repository is for you and the teaching staff only. It should private and not be visible to the world.
* Your first task is to provide staff with read-level access to your repository.
  * The staff accounts for this semester are: 
  	* jbonner@swin.edu.au
	* qtpham@swin.edu.au
* Make sure that your account has your real name, and uses your swinburne email address. This allows us to find you and your work easily.
* We have provided a folder structure for the unit tasks. You must follow this - so tutors know where to expect things.
  * Of course you can add your own new folders for extension and custom work.
  * Use a different folder for each task. Don't combine your new task work with your old code - copy and then change!
  * Do add your documentation to the repo as well - it's not just for code.
* We have provided a basic .gitignore file. You may not see it if your OS hides "hidden" files like this starting with a period. If you don't know about .gitignore files, you should learn about them. It helps you avoid filling your repository with unnecessary files and possibly running out of space.

## I'll add proper stuff later üö®:
